Part 1 Questions

What git command creates a branch?

	git branch [branchname]
	
What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?

	A fast-forward merge is one where the timeline of changes is clear and one branch is a strict addition to the contents of the other. Recursive merges involve more complexity.

What git command changes to another branch?

	git checkout

What git command deletes a branch?

	"git -d [branchname]" deletes a branch if it has been merged to another branch,
	"git -D [branchname] deletes a branch without checking that its contents have been saved.

How do merge conflicts happen?

	Merge conflicts occur when multiple versions of a file exist, both of which have been changed since the branch split. The program has no way to know which change is intended to be kept post-merge, so it requires manual updating.
